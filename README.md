# MacFace
 A simple little Pascal program that draws a face similar to the Finder icon.
 
This is just a cute little graphics demo for classic Macs, written in Pascal.

It's meant to sort of resemble the old Finder icon.

Hope you like it.  You'll need to find a copy of Macintosh Pascal in order to run it.

If you experience carriage return/linefeed issues with the Pascal source code file, use the equivalent text file.
